**Do**
- Use
- Modify/improve
- Share (using these terms)
- Share your modified/improved version (using these terms)
- **Mention my name. Like everytime you share/publish.**

**Don't**
- Sell/use for commercial purposes. Otherwise I would've chosen a GNU/GPL license.
- Not mention my name. **You must mention my name.**
- Not share your improvements. Otherwise I will think you're a selfish person.


As simple as this. Keep it simple, stupid!
